  /**
   * Patterns that, when they match the end of a poll history, indicate that the partition is likely to be resumed in
   * the next poll.
   *
   * Each pattern is given as a bit string where each character is either a '1': the partition was resumed or '0': the
   * partition was paused. The oldest poll comes first and the newest last.
   *
   * '''Run-away feedback loop'''
   *
   * If a pattern matches, the partition will be resumed (causing a `1` to be added to the poll history). If in the next
   * poll, again a pattern matches, the partition will be resumed again, causing a run-away feedback loop of repeated
   * resumes while the stream might not need more data at all. (We do not make a distinction between resumes because of
   * a request for data, or because of an optimistic resume.)
   *
   * For example, the very short pattern `1` causes a run-away feedback loop immediately after the first resume. For the
   * same reason, if pattern `p` is included, `p1` may _not_ be included. (For example, if pattern `101` is included,
   * pattern `1011` may not be included.)
   *
   * '''How these patterns were found'''
   *
   * The patterns were found by iterating over all possible (short) patterns and selecting those that are likely to lead
   * to a resume. Iteration is done by the number of recent resumes or pauses. So first we list all patterns that end
   * with 5 resumes, then all patterns that end with 4 resumes, etc. Then we list all patterns that end with 1 pause,
   * with 2 pauses, etc.
   *
   * For example, lets look at all patterns that end with 2 resumes, so patterns that end with `011`. Just 2 resumes is
   * not a strong signal that the partition is likely to be resumed in the next poll. Therefore, we require that a least
   * 2 more resumes happened shortly before. (Note that this is a choice based on intuition. More research is needed to
   * select optimal requirements.) We do this by extending the pattern to the left. The patterns with at least 2 resumes
   * in 3 polls are: `11`, `101` and `110` (note: `11` matches both `011` and `111`). Prepending this to `011` gives the
   * patterns `11011`, `101011` and `110011`. An arbitrary choice was made to omit patterns with 2 consecutive pauses.
   *
   * Some patterns are not allowed because we want to prevent a run-away feedback loop. For example, because we list
   * pattern `0111`, pattern `01111` is not allowed. So instead of `01111` we include `11101111`.
   *
   * '''Mask and bit pattern'''
   *
   * The patterns are converted into pairs containing a mask and a bit pattern. The mask selects the history bits that
   * need to match the bit pattern.
