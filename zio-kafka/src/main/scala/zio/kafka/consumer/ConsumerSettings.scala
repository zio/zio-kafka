   *
   * Use `false` when:
   *   - your streams do not commit, or
   *   - your streams require access to the consumer (the consumer is not available until the rebalance is done), or
   *   - when it is okay to process records twice (possibly concurrently), for example, because processing is
   *     idempotent.
   *
   * When `true`, messages consumed from revoked partitions must be committed before we allow the rebalance to continue.
   *
   * When a partition is revoked, consuming the messages will be taken over by another consumer. The other consumer will
   * continue from the committed offset. It is therefore important that this consumer commits offsets of all consumed
   * messages. Therefore, by holding up the rebalance until these commits are done, we ensure that the new consumer will
   * start from the correct offset.
   *
   * During a rebalance no new messages can be received _for any stream_. Therefore, _all_ streams are deprived of new
   * messages until the revoked streams are ready committing.
   *
   * Rebalances are held up for at most 3/5 of `maxPollInterval` (see [[withMaxPollInterval]]), by default this
   * calculates to 3 minutes. See [[#withMaxRebalanceDuration]] to change the default.
   *
   * When `false`, streams for revoked partitions may continue to run even though the rebalance is not held up. Any
   * offset commits from these streams have a high chance of being delayed (commits are not possible during some phases
   * of a rebalance). The consumer that takes over the partition will likely not see these delayed commits and will
   * start from an earlier offset. The result is that some messages are processed twice and concurrently.
