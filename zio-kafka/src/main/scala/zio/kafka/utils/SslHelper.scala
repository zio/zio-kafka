  /**
   * Let's take some time here to discuss the algorithm of this function as it's a bit tricky and uses obscure Java
   * APIs/features.
   *
   * The goal of this function is to validate that the SSL configuration of the client is correct for the Kafka cluster
   * we want to contact. (ie. that the Kafka cluster is not configured with SSL as we previously validated that the
   * client was not configured for an SSL server)
   *
   * The algorithm is the following:
   *   1. We open a socket to the Kafka node
   *   1. We send a simple request to the Kafka node to check if it's configured with SSL
   *   1. We read the answer from the Kafka node
   *   1. If the node is configured with SSL, we fail with an error
   *
   * This algorithm and its implementation, per se, are relatively simple. It's the few lines of code inside the
   * `ZIO.attemptBlockingInterrupt` call.
   *
   * The tricky part is that we want to be able to timeout the whole process if it takes too long but timeouting a
   * `SocketChannel` is, theoretically, not possible.
   *
   * Also, we don't want to leak memory so we want to be sure that the socket is closed in all cases (success, failure,
   * or timeout/interruption).
   *
   * The socket might be closed in two possible cases:
   *   1. The socket is successfully opened and we successfully sent the request to the Kafka cluster. In this case, the
   *      `finally` block will close the socket.
   *   1. The networking exchange takes too long and we timeout/interrupt the whole process. In this case, and that's
   *      the most tricky/weird part, to close the socket, we interrupt the thread running it.
   *
   * Why does interrupting the thread running the networking exchange closes the socket? Because the `SocketChannel`
   * class implements the `InterruptibleChannel` interface, and that's a property of this interface.
   *
   * From the documentation of `InterruptibleChannel`, we can read:
   * {{{
   * > A channel that implements this interface is also interruptible:
   * > If a thread is blocked in an I/O operation on an interruptible channel then another thread may invoke the blocked thread's interrupt method.
   * > This will cause the channel to be closed, the blocked thread to receive a ClosedByInterruptException, and the blocked thread's interrupt status to be set.
   * }}}
   *
   * See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/InterruptibleChannel.html
   *
   * Let's recap.
   *
   * We use a `SocketChannel` to test the SSL configuration of the Kafka nodes. This `SocketChannel` is a resource and
   * needs to be closed to avoid leaking memory. We want to be able to timeout the whole process if it takes too long
   * but a `SocketChannel` is not timeoutable. So we implement a timeout mechanism that will interrupt the thread on
   * which the `SocketChannel` is running to close it as it's one of the properties of the `SocketChannel` class.
   *
   * Note that there are unit-tests proving that this works.
