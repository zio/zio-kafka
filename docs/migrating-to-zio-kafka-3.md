ZIO Kafka 3.0.0 brings a number of backwards incompatible changes:

1. Removal of all deprecated methods, _including accessor methods,_
2. Kafka 4.x
3. The transactional producer is now much easier to use,
4. Diagnostics set via consumer settings, 
5. `restartStreamOnRebalancing` mode is no longer supported.

This document helps you migrate from zio-kafka 2 to zio-kafka 3. To upgrade further, from zio-kafka 3 to zio-kafka 4, see [Migrating to zio-kafka 4](migrating-to-zio-kafka-4.md).

In the examples below, code marked as zio-kafka 2.x shows the old API; it is not meant to compile with zio-kafka 3.

## 1. Deprecations

ZIO Kafka 3.0.0 removes everything that was deprecated in the zio-kafka 2.x series. In particular, this includes
accessor methods. To prepare for zio-kafka 3.0, _you should always first migrate to zio-kafka 2.12.0_ and solve all
deprecation issues, using this page as a guide.

### Renamed methods

Some methods have just been renamed. Read the deprecation message and try the new method name. If it compiles, you're
done. Otherwise, read on.

### Consumer, Producer and TransactionalProducer accessor methods

Accessor methods are little helper methods that look up a service from the environment, and then forward your call to
that service. Accessor methods have not been recommended for some time; they were deprecated in zio-kafka 2.11 and have
been removed in zio-kafka 3.0. The
[ZIO service pattern](https://zio.dev/reference/service-pattern/) provides a much cleaner approach for accessing
services.

All accessor methods provided by zio-kafka were deprecated in zio-kafka 2.11 and have been removed in zio-kafka 3.0. If
you use these accessor methods follow one of these approaches:

#### Use the ZIO Service pattern

This is the best option. For established codebases it may be a lot of work to get here. If you are already follow
this pattern, using it for zio-kafka services as well will be easy. See [ZIO service pattern](https://zio.dev/reference/service-pattern/) for more information.

Here is an example with a `Consumer`, but it works the same with `Producer` and `TransactionalProducer`. We get the
`Consumer` from the environment in the layer with the `ZIO.service` method, and then inject it into the service class.
The service now uses the consumer directly, with `consumer` instead of `Consumer`:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.consumer.{ Consumer, Subscription }
import zio.kafka.serde.Serde

trait Service {
  def someMethod: ZIO[Any, Throwable, String]
}

object Service {

  def layer: ZLayer[Consumer, Throwable, Service] = ZLayer {
    for {
      consumer <- ZIO.service[Consumer]
    } yield ServiceLive(consumer)
  }

}

case class ServiceLive(consumer: Consumer) extends Service {

  override def someMethod: ZIO[Any, Throwable, String] =
    // use `consumer`, not `Consumer`:
    consumer
      .plainStream(Subscription.topics("my-topic"), Serde.string, Serde.string)
      .runHead
      .map(_.fold("")(_.value))
}
```

Constructing a `Consumer` layer is described in [creating a consumer](creating-a-consumer.md). Constructing a
`Producer` or `TransactionalProducer` layer works in a similar way.

#### YOLO, use `ZIO.service` everywhere

The other option is to replace all accessor methods of `Consumer`, `Producer` and `TransactionalProducer` as follows:

- `Consumer.method(...)` => `ZIO.serviceWithZIO[Consumer](_.method(...))`
- `Producer.method(...)` => `ZIO.serviceWithZIO[Producer](_.method(...))`
- `TransactionalProducer.method(...)` => `ZIO.serviceWithZIO[TransactionalProducer](_.method(...))`

The accessors that return a stream or a pipeline need a different replacement. For `Consumer.plainStream`, `Consumer.partitionedStream` and `Consumer.partitionedAssignmentStream`, use `ZStream.serviceWithStream[Consumer](_.plainStream(...))` (and likewise for the other two). For `Producer.produceAll`, get the producer with `ZIO.service[Producer]` and use the `Producer#produceAll` pipeline.

Or, alternatively, use `ZIO.service`.

For example: `Consumer.method(...)` is transformed to:
```scala
for {
  consumer <- ZIO.service[Consumer]
  _        <- consumer.method(...)
} yield () 
```

### ZIO Kafka Testkit

ZIO Kafka provides a `zio-kafka-testkit` library to help you test your code using zio-kafka. Several methods in the
`KafkaTestUtils` class have been replaced:

- The `produce*` and `scheduledProduce*` methods, which get a producer from the environment, were deprecated in
  zio-kafka 2.11 and have been removed in zio-kafka 3.0. Each of these methods now only exists as a variant with an
  explicit producer parameter.
- All methods that produce a layer (e.g. `consumer`, `producer`) have _not_ been deprecated, but they have been given a
  more convenient alternative: `makeConsumer`, `makeProducer`, etc. The exception is `minimalConsumer()`, which is
  deprecated since zio-kafka 3.0.0; use `Consumer.live` instead.
- The `withAdmin`, `withSaslAdmin`, `withSslAdmin` methods have been removed and are replaced by `makeAdminClient`,
  `makeSaslAdminClient` and `makeSslAdminClient`.

Here is a typical zio-kafka 2.x test suite:

```scala
// Old (zio-kafka 2.x)
override def spec: Spec[TestEnvironment, Any] =
  suite("old example suite")(
    test("uses a producer") {
      for {
        _ <- KafkaTestUtils.produceOne("topic", "key", "message")
      } yield assertCompletes
    }
  )
    .provideSome[Kafka](KafkaTestUtils.producer)
    .provideShared(Kafka.embedded)
```

In zio-kafka 3.x, the same suite looks like this:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.testkit.{ Kafka, KafkaTestUtils }
import zio.test._

object NewExampleSpec extends ZIOSpecDefault {
  // New (zio-kafka 3.x)
  // Added `Scope`:
  override def spec: Spec[TestEnvironment & Scope, Any] =
    suite("new example suite")(
      test("uses a producer") {
        for {
          // Make a producer explicitly (instead of via a layer):
          producer <- KafkaTestUtils.makeProducer
          // Notice explicit producer parameter:
          _ <- KafkaTestUtils.produceOne(producer, "topic", "key", "message")
        } yield assertCompletes
      }
    )
      // Producer layer removed.
      // Using `provideSomeShared[Scope]` instead of `provideShared`:
      .provideSomeShared[Scope](Kafka.embedded)
}
```

`KafkaTestUtils.makeProducer` and the other `make*` methods require a `Scope` in the environment. This scope is
normally provided by the test framework (notice how `Scope` was added to the type parameter of `Spec`). If needed, a
smaller scope can be given with the `ZIO.scoped` method. See also [writing tests](writing-tests.md) for details on how
to provide more layers.

Here is code that uses one of the removed `with*Admin` methods:

```scala
// Old (zio-kafka 2.x)
KafkaTestUtils.withAdmin { adminClient =>
  adminClient.method() // Use the admin client...
}
```

In zio-kafka 3.x, we make the admin client explicitly instead:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.testkit.{ Kafka, KafkaTestUtils }

// New (zio-kafka 3.x)
val useAdminClient: ZIO[Scope & Kafka, Throwable, Unit] =
  for {
    adminClient <- KafkaTestUtils.makeAdminClient
    _           <- adminClient.listTopics() // Use the admin client...
  } yield ()
```

## 2. Kafka 4.x

Starting with 3.0.0, zio-kafka is based on the kafka 4.0.0 client. This has a number of consequences:

* Java 11 support is dropped. Even though the kafka client library still supports java 11, zio-kafka's unit tests
  depend on an embedded kafka broker and the kafka brokers no longer support it.
* `ConsumerGroupState` (used in the admin client) was renamed to `GroupState`, unfortunately without a deprecation
  cycle.
* Due to [KAFKA-18818](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-18818), admin operations are eventually consistent.
  zio-kafka 3.0 to 3.3 added a fixed 550ms delay after operations like `createTopic`, `deleteTopic` and `createAcls`
  in the admin client; 3.4 removed it, after earlier releases had already replaced it for some operations. Since zio-kafka 3.6.0, the admin client polls
  the broker until the change is visible (for at most 5 seconds), and operations whose effect it cannot check accept a
  `visibilitySleep` parameter (default 1 second).
* Two deprecated methods of kafka's admin client were removed. Their equivalent in zio-kafka were unfortunately not
  deprecated yet but had to be removed as well:
  * `AdminClient.alterConfigs` was removed, use `AdminClient.incrementalAlterConfigs` instead.
  * `AdminClient.alterConfigsAsync` was removed, use `AdminClient.incrementalAlterConfigsAsync` instead.

There may be more changes that affect you. See the [Kafka 4.0.0 release announcement](https://kafka.apache.org/blog#apache_kafka_400_release_announcement) for more details.

## 3. Changes in the transactional producer

The transactional producer is now much easier to use. The zio-kafka 2.x transactional API is so complicated that we
expect only a few very experienced users to make use of it. Therefore, only the new API is described in
[transactions](transactions.md).

## 4. Diagnostics set via consumer settings

Diagnostics, an optional callback for key events in the consumer life-cycle, is now set via
`ConsumerSettings.withDiagnostics`. In zio-kafka 2.x it was the second (optional) argument to `Consumer.make`, or an
additional input layer for `Consumer.live`.

### Migrate a layers app without diagnostics

If your program uses ZIO layers, but you don't need diagnostics, it will look like this:

```scala
// zio-kafka 2.x
.provide(
  consumerSettingsLayer,
  ZLayer.succeed(Consumer.NoDiagnostics), // 1
  Consumer.live
)
```

For zio-kafka 3.x simply remove the line marked with `// 1` and you are done.

### Migrate uses of `Consumer.make` with diagnostics

In zio-kafka 2.x, the diagnostics were the second argument of `Consumer.make`:

```scala
// zio-kafka 2.x
val diagnostics = ???
val settings = ConsumerSettings(bootstrap)
val consumer = Consumer.make(settings, diagnostics)
```

Rewrite your code so that the diagnostics are part of the settings:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.consumer.{ Consumer, ConsumerSettings }

val bootstrap = List("localhost:9092")

// zio-kafka 3.x
val diagnostics: Consumer.ConsumerDiagnostics = ???
val settings                                  = ConsumerSettings(bootstrap).withDiagnostics(diagnostics)
val consumer: ZIO[Scope, Throwable, Consumer] = Consumer.make(settings)
```

### Migrate a layers app with diagnostics

In case your application provides diagnostics via a layer, providing the layers looks like this:

```scala
// zio-kafka 2.x
.provide(
  consumerSettingsLayer,
  diagnosticsLayer,
  Consumer.live
)
```

The cleanest solution is to merge the code that constructs `diagnosticsLayer` into the code that constructs
`consumerSettingsLayer`.

The other option is to apply a 'quick fix' that transforms the two layers into a single layer:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.consumer.{ Consumer, ConsumerSettings }

val consumerSettingsLayer: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, ConsumerSettings]        = ???
val diagnosticsLayer: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, Consumer.ConsumerDiagnostics] = ???
val program: ZIO[Consumer, Throwable, Unit]                                = ???

// zio-kafka 3.x
program.provide(
  (consumerSettingsLayer ++ diagnosticsLayer) >>> ZLayer {
    for {
      settings    <- ZIO.service[ConsumerSettings]
      diagnostics <- ZIO.service[Consumer.ConsumerDiagnostics]
    } yield settings.withDiagnostics(diagnostics)
  },
  Consumer.live
)
```

## 5. `restartStreamOnRebalancing` mode

This mode is no longer available in zio-kafka 3. With `restartStreamOnRebalancing` all streams are ended during a
rebalance, even when the partition for that stream was not revoked. One of its purposes was to enable transactional
consuming. Since zio-kafka 3 however, transactional consuming no longer needs this mode.

If your goal is to [prevent duplicates](preventing-duplicates.md), please use `rebalanceSafeCommits` instead.
