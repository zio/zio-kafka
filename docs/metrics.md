title: "Zio-Kafka Metrics"
---

Zio-kafka exposes all the metrics of the wrapped Java based consumer and producer, plus some more metrics about the
zio-kafka consumer itself.

## Java client metrics

The metrics from the Java metrics can be obtained via the `Consumer.metrics` and `Producer.metrics` methods. Both
return a live view on the internal metrics of the consumer/producer. We currently do not expose these metrics elsewhere,
a PR to copy them to the zio-metrics API is welcome.

## Zio-kafka consumer metrics

The zio-kafka consumer collects some additional metrics using the zio-metrics API. This allows any zio-metrics backend
to access and process the observed values.

By default, no tags are added. Tags can be configured via `ConsumerSettings.withMetricsLabels`.

Like the zio-metrics we follow Prometheus conventions. This means that:

- durations are expressed in seconds,
- counters can only increase,
- metric names use snake_case and end in the unit where possible.

The histograms each use 10 buckets. To reach a decent range while keeping sufficient accuracy at the low end, most
bucket boundaries use an exponential series based on ùëí.

### Poll metrics

| Type      | Name                                                  | Description                                                                        |

| counter   | `ziokafka_consumer_poll_auth_errors`                  | The number of polls that ended with an authentication or authorization error.      |

### Partition stream metrics

These metrics are updated after every poll.

| Type      | Name                                 | Description                                                            |

| histogram | `ziokafka_consumer_all_queue_size`   | The total number of records queued for all partitions.                 |
| histogram | `ziokafka_consumer_queue_polls`      | The number of polls during which records are idling in a queue.        |

### Commit metrics

These metrics measure the separate commit requests issued through zio-kafka's api.

| Type       | Name                                       | Description                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| histogram  | `ziokafka_consumer_pending_commits`        | The number of commits that are awaiting completion. |
| counterInt | `ziokafka_consumer_commits`                | The number of commits.                              |
| histogram  | `ziokafka_consumer_commit_latency_seconds` | The duration of a commit in seconds.                |


### Aggregated commit metrics

After every poll zio-kafka combines all outstanding commit requests into 1 aggregated commit. These metrics are for the aggregated commits.

| Type       | Name                                                  | Description                                                                |

| histogram  | `ziokafka_consumer_aggregated_commit_latency_seconds` | The duration of an aggregated commit in seconds.                           |
| histogram  | `ziokafka_consumer_aggregated_commit_size`            | An approximation of the number of records (offsets) per aggregated commit. |
