title: "Tuning the consumer"
---

Zio-kafka's consumer can be tuned for:

* throughput
* latency
* memory usage
* long-running processes / slow consumers

All tuning is done via `ConsumerSettings` (see [consumer](consumer.md)):

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.kafka.consumer.ConsumerSettings

val bootstrapServers = List("localhost:9092")
val groupId          = "my-group"
val properties       = Map[String, AnyRef]("fetch.min.bytes" -> "1")

val settings = ConsumerSettings(bootstrapServers)
  .withGroupId(groupId)
  .withProperties(properties)
```

Read on for more details.

## Names

Two very similarly named settings are relevant. Don't mix them up:

* `pollTimeout` — how long a poll may take
* `max.poll.interval.ms` — the maximum time between polls

## Throughput and latency

The kafka client can be tuned for either high throughput or low latency, unfortunately not both.
The most important settings for tuning throughput and latency are:

* zio-kafka's `pollTimeout` — This is the maximum time to block while polling the Kafka consumer. Zio-kafka's default
  is `50ms` which is good for low latency applications. Set this higher, e.g. `500ms` for better throughput.
* kafka's [configuration `max.poll.records`](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_max.poll.records) — The maximum number of records a poll will return. Kafka defaults
  this to `500`. You can set this higher for more throughput, or lower for lower latency.
* zio-kafka's fetch-strategy `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit` — when the number of records in a partition queue is
  at or below this value, zio-kafka will start to pre-fetch and buffer more records from Kafka. The default value for
  this parameter is `1024`; 2 * the default `max.poll.records` of 500, rounded to the nearest power of 2.

Zio-kafka provides 2 methods that set these settings for 2 common use cases: `ConsumerSettings.tuneForHighThroughput`
and `ConsumerSettings.tuneForLowLatency`.
Note that their implementation may vary over time. You can use them as follows:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.kafka.consumer.ConsumerSettings

val bootstrapServers = List("localhost:9092")

val highThroughputSettings = ConsumerSettings(bootstrapServers).tuneForHighThroughput
val lowLatencySettings = ConsumerSettings(bootstrapServers).tuneForLowLatency
```

Currently, `ConsumerSettings#tuneForHighThroughput` sets `pollTimeout` to `500ms`, `max.poll.records` to `2000` and `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit` to `4096`, while `ConsumerSettings#tuneForLowLatency` sets them to `50ms`, `100` and `512`. Both methods replace the configured `FetchStrategy` with a `QueueSizeBasedFetchStrategy`, and so does `ConsumerSettings#withPartitionPreFetchBufferLimit`. Call them before `ConsumerSettings#withFetchStrategy`, otherwise a custom fetch strategy is silently discarded.

## Small and large records

Kafka’s performance is not very sensitive to record size. However, when records become very small (< 100 bytes) it
might be beneficial to increase `max.poll.records` and `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit`. Similarly, when records are
very large (> 100Kb), `max.poll.records` can be decreased. Also, pre-fetching can be limited by decreasing
`partitionPreFetchBufferLimit` or even disabled by using `ConsumerSettings#withoutPartitionPreFetching`.

## High number of partitions

When a lot of partitions need to be consumed, we need to take into account that heap is needed to store the records in
the partition queues. A very rough estimate for the maximum amount of heap needed is given by: `average record size` *
`number of partitions` * max(`partitionPreFetchBufferLimit`, `max.poll.records`).

The total can be tuned by changing the `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit`, `max.poll.records` settings.

Another option is to use a different `FetchStrategy`, for example the built-in
`zio.kafka.consumer.fetch.ManyPartitionsQueueSizeBasedFetchStrategy` (since zio-kafka 2.8.1), which also caps the total
queue size over all partitions:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.kafka.consumer.ConsumerSettings
import zio.kafka.consumer.fetch.ManyPartitionsQueueSizeBasedFetchStrategy

val settings = ConsumerSettings(List("localhost:9092"))
  .withFetchStrategy(
    ManyPartitionsQueueSizeBasedFetchStrategy(maxPartitionQueueSize = 1024, maxTotalQueueSize = 20480)
  )
```

You can also write a custom `FetchStrategy`.

## Long-running processes / slow consumers

To detect stalled consumers, Kafka revokes a partition when a consumer does not poll within the max poll interval (see
[configuration `max.poll.interval.ms`](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_max.poll.interval.ms)). The default max poll interval is 5 minutes. After a partition is revoked,
it will be assigned to another consumer.

In zio-kafka a stream needs to pull data within the max stream pull interval (`ConsumerSettings#withMaxStreamPullInterval`,
since zio-kafka 2.9.0), which defaults to `max.poll.interval.ms` (in versions 2.5.1 up to 2.8.x it is always the max poll
interval). If this doesn't happen, the stream is interrupted with a failure and the whole consumer shuts down.

To prevent the above failure states, either decrease `max.poll.records` (so that time between polling gets shorter),
and/or increase `max.poll.interval.ms` (so that the time between polls may be longer).

To see if your application must be configured with a lower `max.poll.records` and/or a higher `max.poll.interval.ms`
value we need to consider the maximum duration between polls. If processing is sequential, we can obtain this maximum by
multiplying `max.poll.records` with the maximum duration to process a single record. To also accommodate things like
long garbage collections and buffering, configuration `max.poll.interval.ms` should be substantially higher than the
maximum processing time.

`max.poll.records`, `max.poll.interval.ms` and the max stream pull interval can be set with:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.consumer.ConsumerSettings

val settings = ConsumerSettings(List("localhost:9092"))
  .withMaxPollRecords(1)
  .withMaxPollInterval(15.minutes)
  .withMaxStreamPullInterval(15.minutes)
```

On older zio-kafka versions `ConsumerSettings#withMaxPollInterval` is not available. Use the following instead:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.kafka.consumer.ConsumerSettings

val settings = ConsumerSettings(List("localhost:9092"))
  .withProperty("max.poll.interval.ms", 15.minutes.toMillis.toString)
```

### Long-running processes and `rebalance-safe-commits`

When `rebalance-safe-commits` is enabled, additional settings are needed for long-running processes. See
[preventing duplicates](preventing-duplicates.md) for more details.

### Long-running processes and silent authorization failures

When topics are quiet or experience long idle periods, configuring a low threshold for silent authorization failure
detection (`emptyPollCountToMetaRefresh`) can trigger excessive offset-fetch requests.
See [detecting authorization failures](detecting-authorization-failures.md) for how to tune this setting for low-volume
topics.

## Using metrics to tune the consumer

Zio-Kafka exposes [metrics](metrics.md) that can be used to further tune the consumer. To interpret these metrics you need to know how zio-kafka works internally.

![](consumer-internals.svg)

The runloop is at the heart of every zio-kafka consumer.
It creates a zstream for each partition, eventually this is the zstream your applications consumes from.
When the zstream starts, and every time the records queue is empty, it sends a request for data to the runloop.
The request makes the runloop poll. Partitions whose queue size is at or below the `FetchStrategy`'s limit are resumed, so the next poll may receive records for them.
Any received records are put in the records queue.
When the queue reaches a certain size (as determined by the configured `FetchStrategy`), the partition is paused.
Meanwhile, the zstream reads from the queue and emits the records to your application.

An optimally configured consumer has the following properties:

- the zstreams never have to wait for new records (to get high throughput),
- most of the time, the record queues are empty (to get low latency and low heap usage).

The following strategy can help you get to this state:

1. First make sure that `pollTimeout` and `max.poll.records` make sense for the latency and throughput requirements
   of your application.
2. Configure `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit` to `0` (`ConsumerSettings#withPartitionPreFetchBufferLimit(0)`).
3. Observe metric `ziokafka_consumer_queue_polls` which gives the number of polls during which records are idling in
   the queue.
4. Increase `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit` in steps until most measurements of the `ziokafka_consumer_queue_polls`
   histogram are in the lowest bucket (`le="1.0"`; zio-metrics ignores the `0` bucket boundary).

During this process, it is useful to observe metric `ziokafka_consumer_queue_size` (number of records in the queues) to
see if the queues are indeed increasing in size.

When many (hundreds of) partitions need to be consumed, the metric `ziokafka_consumer_all_queue_size` should also be
observed as increasing `partitionPreFetchBufferLimit` can lead to high heap usage. (See 'High number of partitions'
above.)
